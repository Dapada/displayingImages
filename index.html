		<h3>Displaying Images</h3>
		<p>
			<img src="2021croisadeEvangelique.gif" width="400" height="235" alt="Picture with a quote"> &quot;Okay, so we're looking at images.html, which is located in the examples Lecture10 folder. And you may recognize this file from a few lectures ago where this is a famous quote from Theodore Roosevelt. And, by the way, I apologize, I made a typo before. Theodore Roosevelt is spelled with an E. So for you eagle eyes out there who noticed that I misspelled Theodore I apologize. It was just a typo. Anyway our task here is to display an image right before the quote itself. And we actually have a couple of images here. And since I wanted to start with one, let me comment this one out, and at the same time show you what an HTML comment looks like. And it's pretty simple, it starts with a less than bracket, exclamation point, dash, dash, and then it gets closed with a dash, dash, right angle bracket. And what will happen when you load this page into the browser Is that the browser will completely ignore this comment and will not render it. So let's take a look at the image tag that we wanted to discuss. The image is displayed in HTML using this img tag which is just short for image. And the src attribute of the img tag is a URL that points to some image file. Now this URL is no different than the href that you've seen with the regular link A tag. It could be a relative URL, or it can be an absolute URL, even one that contains an external link. Next, we specifiy the width and the height of the image. While not absolutely required, it's a really good idea to always specify the width and the height. And I will demonstrate to you in a few minutes why that is. And also the alt tag which is used by screen readers that help people with visual impairment. Let's save the document and take a look at it in the browser &quot;.
